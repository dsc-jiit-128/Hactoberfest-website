                <b>I signed up for Hacktoberfest mid-October. Will pull requests that I created earlier in October count?</b>
                <p>Yes, all pull requests created between Oct 1 and Oct 31 will count, regardless of when you register for Hacktoberfest. 
                    Pull requests that are still in review after Oct 31 and meet the criteria will count towards your completion goal.

                    What is considered a valid pull request?
                </b>
                <p>
                    A valid pull request is one that is accepted by the maintainer of the project you submit it to.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                A pull request is considered approved once it has an overall approving review from maintainers, or has been merged by maintainers, or has been given the 'hacktoberfest-accepted' label. 
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>The pull request must contain commits you made yourself.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <b>What is a pull request? </b>
                <p>
                    Pull requests are proposed code changes you can submit to a branch in a repository on GitHub/GitLab. Once submitted, a project maintainer will review and discuss the changes before they become final. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Do pull requests have to be accepted/merged?</b>
                <p>
                    Your pull requests will count toward your participation if they are in a repository with the 'hacktoberfest 'topic and once they have been merged, approved by a maintainer or labeled as "hacktoberfest-accepted". 
                    <br>
                    Additionally, any pull request with the **hacktoberfest-accepted** label, submitted to any public GitHub/GitLab repository, with or without the hacktoberfest topic, will be considered valid for Hacktoberfest.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>What should I do if I contribute to a repository that is not participating in Hacktoberfest?</b>
                <p>
                    You can politely request the maintainer of the project you contributed to, to tag your contribution with the label **hacktoberfest-accepted** . Or, add the 'hacktoberfest' topic to the repository to opt the project into Hacktoberfest.
                    <br>
                    Any pull request with the **hacktoberfest-accepted** label, submitted to any public GitHub/GitLab repository, with or without the hacktoberfest topic, will be considered valid for Hacktoberfest.
                </p>

                <b>As a maintainer, how should I handle spam pull requests?</b>
                <p>
                    We dislike seeing spam pull requests just as much as you, so please give them an "invalid" or "spam" label and close them. Pull requests that contain a label with the word "invalid" or "spam" won’t be counted toward Hacktoberfest.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>As a maintainer, how do I encourage contributions to my repos?</b>
                <p>
                    First, classify your repository with the 'hacktoberfest' topic. This will alert participants that your repo is participating in Hacktoberfest. <br>
                    You can also create issues for anything you’d like contributors to help with, making sure to give them a **hacktoberfest-accepted** label so they’re easier to discover. <br>
                    You can also share issues or repositories on Twitter, using #Hacktoberfest. We’ll try to retweet as many as we can for contributors to see!

                <b>How can I exclude my repository from Hacktoberfest? </b>
                <p>
                    We’ve changed the program to only count pull requests that are made to repositories with a 'hacktoberfest' topic or labeled with **hacktoberfest-accepted**. <br>
                    Due to this change, it’s no longer necessary for maintainers to opt out of Hacktoberfest.

                <b>Will I have to pay anything/custom tax/duty for the T-shirt?</b>
                <p>
                    We write down a low enough dollar value on the mailed packages that we don’t expect any issues with customs tax, but we cannot guarantee that – you might have to pay a small fee depending on your country’s import policies. DigitalOcean and Kotis Design will not issue a refund for shipping/duty fees.
                </p>

                <b>When will my T-shirt be shipped? (Intl)</b>
                <p>
                    You will receive an email once your T-shirt is shipped. Due to COVID-19 delivery delays, it can take up to 6-8  weeks after shipment for international orders to be delivered.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>What T-shirt size should I order?</b>
                <p>
                    You can reference the size charts for the T-shirts on the ordering page. Both size charts include measurements in inches, and instructions for how to measure yourself.
